name: Programmatic Lattice Generator (PLG)
description: The Programmatic Lattice Generator (PLG) is a software tool for generating
  lattice structures through the repetition of strut based lattice unit cells. The
  code has an extended library of unit cell topologies and additional functionality.
  It provides information on connectivity, length, orientation and printability of
  each strut element. The code has been used to generate lattice geometry for finite
  element models and additively manufactured parts presented in multiple peer-reviewed
  journal articles. This software has been extended to include tools that aid in the
  deployment of optimal AM structures including radial transformations and manufacturability
  assessment.
